DataStage is designed to work with the **Ubuntu Linux 11.10 [Oneiric Ocelot](http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Oneiric) operating system**, and the Virtual Machines work with **[VMWare Fusion 4.x](http://www.vmware.com/support/fusion4/doc/releasenotes_fusion_401.html).**

For instructions to install DataStage, see the ReadMe file that comes zipped with the installation files. 

If you use **OSX Lion and Virtual Box**, and are installing from debian packages, we have some additional information on the issue tracker, here: [http://dataflow-jira.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/jira/browse/DATAFLOW-268](http://dataflow-jira.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/jira/browse/DATAFLOW-268)
